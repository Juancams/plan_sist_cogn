# SCAN FAKE

## Description

<p align="justify">
Project 0. 
In this exercise we have to generate a fake scan of 360ยบ laser, which publishes 100 random readings at 1 Hz, following a normal distribution with mean 4 and a standard deviation 1. 
There is also a subscriber node that shows the average, maximum and minimum values of the 100 readings.

In the following gif and video you can see the simulation on rviz2, the bandwidth and the frequency:
